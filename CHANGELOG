1.1-2: January 31, 2012
    * Added a Red Hat spec file, one that *should* work (knock on
      wood!) with OpenSUSE.
    * Overhauled the configure script.
    * Minor tweaks, but nothing user-facing.

1.1-1: January 30, 2012
    * Fixed a formatting error in the manpage that only manifested
      on Mac OS X.  There were no code changes.

1.1: January 30, 2012
    * Support for version 2.0 of the nsrlsvr wire protocol.  This
      introduces TCP connection reuse, which will substantially
      help performance when making extraordinarily large (think
      millions) of queries.  Protocol version 2.0 introduces
      UPSHIFT, DOWNSHIFT and STATUS commands, but nsrllookup does
      not support these.
    * UNIX now uses poll()-based I/O rather than blocking I/O.
      This isn't as big of a win as some people think.  Server-
      side, yes, it's a big deal, but for nsrllookup it won't
      result in significant performance gains -- it'll just use
      fewer CPU cycles.
    * The Win32 client uses select()-based I/O rather than blocking
      I/O.  Microsoft introduced WSAPoll() in Windows Vista, which
      is a very close relative to BSD poll().  Unfortunately for us,
      nsrllookup needs to run on Windows XP machines.
    * Error messages are now slightly improved.
    * Now comes with a manpage

1.0.6: January 19, 2012
    * Complete rewrite of the nsrllookup code.  Originally it
      was written in Python in order to get a semi-useful system
      written quickly, but the plan was always to rewrite it for
      native code.  (It makes it a lot easier for Win32 users,
      as well as first responders who can't install Python on the
      machines they're inspecting.)

    * Some command-line options have changed since 1.0.5.
