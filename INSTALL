Installation follows the same './configure && make && make install'
dance you're used to.  There should be no real surprises here.

Although I aim for zero-warning builds, each compiler and each
operating system are different.  (For instance, Ubuntu Linux's GCC
package issues a lot more warnings than Fedora's.)  If you find any
warnings please tell me about them, as well as what operating system
and compiler you're using.
